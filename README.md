# Numerical-Techniques-Matlab-project
Numerical techniques play a crucial role in engineering applications where analytical solutions may be difficult or impossible to obtain. 
These methods involve using numerical algorithms to solve mathematical problems and simulate physical phenomena. 
Here are some common numerical techniques used in engineering:

# Root Finding:

Method of Bisection: Divides the interval into two subintervals and narrows down the range until a root is found.
Newton-Raphson Method: Iterative method for finding roots using local linear approximation.
Secant Method: Similar to Newton-Raphson but uses a finite difference approximation for the derivative.
Linear Algebra:

# Matrix Operations: 
Solving linear systems of equations, eigenvalue problems, and matrix factorizations.
LU Decomposition: Decomposing a matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix.

# Interpolation and Extrapolation:

 Interpolation: 
Constructs a polynomial that passes through given data points.
Newton's Divided Differences: Another method for polynomial interpolation.
Spline Interpolation: Uses piecewise-defined polynomials to interpolate data.
Numerical Integration:

 Trapezoidal Rule: 
Approximates the definite integral using trapezoids under the curve.
Simpson's Rule: More accurate method using quadratic polynomials to approximate the integral.
Differential Equations:

 Finite Difference Methods: 
Numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) by discretizing space and time.
Euler's Method: Simple method for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerically.
Runge-Kutta Methods: Higher-order ODE solvers, such as the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.
